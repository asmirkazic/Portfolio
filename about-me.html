      <h3>Why I choose this program?</h3>
      <p class ="mydesign">I was referred to this program by a co-corker of mine. His wife completed the Front End Development certificate program provided by the University of Washington. She found it very
      <br>useful and was able to use the learned skills to obtain gainful employment. I am also working on a web application at my job and could use the web development skillset to assist my team.</p>
